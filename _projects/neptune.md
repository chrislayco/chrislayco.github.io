Neptune ROV is a Marine Remote Operated Vehicle developed at Santa Clara University's Robotics Systems Lab. It incorporates an enhanced electronics suite and an advanced software control system, enabling seamless thruster-based maneuvering, precise control over sensors and peripherals, and real-time display of underwater camera imagery. The system is designed for use in challenging aquatic environments, allowing operators to navigate, monitor, and collect data with ease.

At the heart of the system is an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows pilots to control the robot's movements, monitor sensor data, and view live camera footage, all in a user-friendly environment. The Neptune ROV's robust design and sophisticated control systems make it an ideal tool for underwater exploration, research, and various remote sensing applications.
