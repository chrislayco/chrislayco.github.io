## about
Created with Autodesk Maya, this animation is inspired by the hectic energy of a busy intersection, aiming to capture the feeling of being overwhelmed with tasks but unsure of where to start. By using simple objects in a complex composition, the animation conveys chaos and confusion. Strategic lighting highlights specific areas, setting a disorienting tone, while the cameraâ€™s angles and movements further intensify the unease. The animation follows a driver navigating the intersection, exploring the surreal environment shaped by the dynamic interplay of elements.
