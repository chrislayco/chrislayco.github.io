## about
the inspiration for this animation comes from the business and chaos of a busy intersection. the goal is to create the feeling of uneasiness that is similar to the feeling when you have a lot to do, but are not sure what to do. all of the objects are given a simple look, but i use them to create a more complex composition. lights are a method i use to accentuate specific areas and set the tone. i also use the various attributes of the camera to create different effects. 
the animation follows a driver and his journey around the intersection, exploring the weird atmosphere that all the different objects bring into the scene.
