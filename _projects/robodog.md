## about
The Robot Dog Control System Software Development project involves creating a custom control system for a robot dog, designed to implement advanced locomotion and sensor integration. Using a Raspberry Pi and Python, the software interfaces with multiple hardware modules via I2C and socket networking. Key components include a PCA9685 16-Channel Servo Driver for controlling servo motors, enabling realistic movement based on precise kinematics.

The project also integrates various sensory inputs, including an IMU for orientation sensing, a passive buzzer for auditory alerts, and a LED strip for providing visual feedback to the user. One of the core features is the development of a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for a remote client device, which allows users to send commands and receive real-time sensor data. The system is designed to ensure minimal latency (under 10ms), providing smooth and responsive control for the robot dogâ€™s operations.

This system is focused on enabling intuitive, efficient control while showcasing advanced robotics integration, making the robot dog more interactive and easier to operate in various environments.
