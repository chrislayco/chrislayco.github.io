art boids is a co-creative system that allows users to make abstract art using  simulated movement of a flock of birds. Each agent, known as a "boid," acts as a drawer on a canvas that users can interact with and customize to create art. the movements of the boids is based on craig reynolds ``boids" algorithm, which causes each boid to move based on the position of nearly objects and other boids.
