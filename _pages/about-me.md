I have a passion for creating things. As a computer engineer, programming and software development are the platforms that I have found to be the best ways for me express my creativity. I am driven by a desire to learn and master new skills- and as I create and work on new projects, I face new challenges that push me harder to solve difficult problems or hone skills that I have already gained. I want to continue to create new things that everyone can use and enjoy.
